# Technical PRD Review

Conduct comprehensive technical review of Product Requirements Document from GitHub ticket: $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
Review PRD/ticket from a technical perspective to identify gaps, ambiguities, technical constraints, and clarification needs BEFORE functional specification creation.

## Prerequisites
1. **Extract GitHub ticket information** using WebFetch or gh command
2. **Verify ticket contains** product requirements or feature description
3. **Ensure current working directory** matches branch context if applicable

## Technical Review Process

### 1. **Requirements Analysis**
- **Problem Statement Clarity**: Is the business problem clearly defined?
- **Success Criteria Definition**: Are measurable outcomes specified?
- **User Journey Mapping**: Are user workflows and interactions clear?
- **Scope Boundaries**: What is explicitly included/excluded?
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Are testable acceptance criteria provided?

### 2. **Technical Feasibility Assessment**
- **Architecture Integration**: How does this fit with existing system architecture?
- **Technology Stack Alignment**: Does this work with current tech stack?
- **Data Requirements**: What data needs to be stored, processed, or migrated?
- **Performance Implications**: Are there performance considerations or constraints?
- **Security Requirements**: What security considerations are needed?

### 3. **Domain Expertise Consultation - PARALLEL EXECUTION**
**IMPORTANT**: Consult specialist agents SIMULTANEOUSLY for efficient review.

Based on PRD domains, spawn parallel consultations with relevant specialists (see `.claude/includes/engineering/specialist-mapping.md`):

**Execute in parallel**: "Simultaneously consult all relevant domain specialists to provide their technical perspectives on this PRD."

- **Authentication Features** → Authentication specialists for security patterns and auth architecture
- **Backend Requirements** → Backend specialists for API design and data architecture  
- **Frontend Features** → Frontend specialists for UI/UX feasibility and component architecture
- **Database Changes** → Database specialists for schema implications and migration strategy
- **Real-time Features** → Signaling specialists for WebRTC/Socket.io implementation needs
- **Performance Concerns** → Performance specialists for optimization and scalability
- **Testing Requirements** → Testing specialists for testability and quality assurance

**Parallel Execution Approach**: Identify all applicable domains from the PRD, then invoke all relevant specialists simultaneously to gather comprehensive technical feedback efficiently.

### 4. **Gap Identification**
Identify missing technical information:
- **API Specifications**: Are required endpoints and data models clear?
- **Database Schema**: Are data storage requirements specified?
- **Integration Points**: Are external service integrations defined?
- **Error Handling**: How should edge cases and errors be handled?
- **Migration Strategy**: If modifying existing features, how to handle migration?

### 5. **Risk Assessment**
- **Technical Complexity**: Rate implementation complexity (Low/Medium/High)
- **Dependencies**: Identify blocking dependencies on other systems/teams
- **Resource Requirements**: Estimate development effort and expertise needed
- **Timeline Feasibility**: Assess if requirements are achievable in expected timeframe
- **Breaking Changes**: Identify potential impact on existing functionality

## Review Output Format

### Technical PRD Review Summary
```markdown
## Technical PRD Review: [Feature Name]

### Requirements Quality Assessment
- **Problem Statement**: ✅ Clear / ⚠️ Needs Clarification / ❌ Missing
- **Success Criteria**: ✅ Well-defined / ⚠️ Vague / ❌ Missing  
- **User Workflows**: ✅ Complete / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Unclear
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ Testable / ⚠️ Needs refinement / ❌ Missing

### Technical Feasibility
- **Architecture Fit**: [Assessment and notes]
- **Technology Alignment**: [Compatibility with current stack]
- **Performance Impact**: [Expected impact and mitigation needs]
- **Security Considerations**: [Required security measures]

### Specialist Consultation Results

- **Integration Complexity**: [Assessment of system integration needs]
- **Implementation Approach**: [Recommended technical approach]

### Missing Information & Clarifications Needed
1. **[Category]**: [Specific question or missing detail]
2. **[Category]**: [Specific question or missing detail]
[Continue for all identified gaps]

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Reasoning]
- **Key Dependencies**: [List of blocking dependencies]
- **Timeline Concerns**: [Feasibility assessment]
- **Breaking Changes**: [Potential impacts on existing features]

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions**: [Required clarifications before spec creation]
2. **Technical Considerations**: [Key technical decisions needed]
3. **Resource Planning**: [Estimated effort and expertise requirements]
4. **Risk Mitigation**: [Strategies for identified risks]

### Next Steps
- [ ] Address clarification questions with stakeholders
- [ ] **Update GitHub ticket with technical clarifications received**
- [ ] **Add technical review summary as ticket comment**
- [ ] Proceed to functional specification creation
- [ ] Schedule technical design review if needed

## Post-Review Actions

### When Clarifications Are Provided
1. **Update Original Ticket Description**: Incorporate clarified requirements into the main ticket description
2. **Add Technical Review Comment**: Post the complete technical review summary as a ticket comment
3. **Tag Relevant Stakeholders**: Mention product owners, architects, or domain experts who provided clarifications
4. **Update Ticket Status**: Change status to indicate technical review is complete
5. **Link to Documentation**: Reference any additional technical documentation created

### Ticket Update Template
```markdown
## Technical Review Completed

### Clarifications Incorporated:
- [List key clarifications received and incorporated]

### Technical Assessment Summary:
- **Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Key Dependencies**: [List main dependencies]
- **Recommended Approach**: [Brief technical approach summary]

### Ready for Implementation Planning
- All technical questions resolved
- Architecture integration path defined
- Resource requirements estimated
- Risk mitigation strategies identified

Next Step: Functional specification creation
```
```

## Decision Points

### ✅ **Ready for Functional Spec** if:
- All major technical questions answered
- Architecture integration path clear
- No blocking technical unknowns
- Resource requirements understood

### ⚠️ **Needs Clarification** if:
- Key technical details missing
- Ambiguous requirements identified
- Integration approach unclear
- Significant technical risks present

**ACTION REQUIRED**: 
1. **STOP and present clarification questions** to user
2. **WAIT for stakeholder responses** to all questions
3. **After receiving clarifications**: Update GitHub ticket with resolved requirements
4. **Add technical review comment** documenting the review process and outcomes
5. **ONLY THEN proceed** to functional specification creation

### ❌ **Not Ready** if:
- Major technical feasibility concerns
- Conflicting requirements identified  
- Insufficient detail for implementation planning
- Blocking dependencies unresolved

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Before Functional Specification
- Use this review to validate PRD completeness
- Identify and resolve technical ambiguities
- Ensure all domains have provided input

### Document Updates
- **Update GitHub ticket** with technical clarifications
- **Add technical review comment** summarizing findings
- **Tag relevant stakeholders** for clarification responses

### Handoff to Functional Spec
- Provide reviewed and clarified requirements
- Include specialist consultation results
- Document technical constraints and decisions

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Review feature requirements
/technical-prd-review https://github.com/yourorg/repo/issues/456

# Review with specific technical focus
/technical-prd-review https://github.com/yourorg/repo/issues/789 --focus=security,performance
```

This command ensures technical due diligence is performed on all requirements before investment in detailed functional specification creation, reducing rework and improving implementation success rates.
