#### Documentation Sources Priority
1. **Official Documentation** (via MCP docs servers)
2. **GitHub Examples and Patterns** (via GitHub MCP server)
3. **Community Best Practices** (via web search MCP)
4. **Project-Specific Patterns** (via local codebase analysis)

### 5. Specialist Agent Consultation Process

#### Authentication Requirements Analysis
When specifications involve authentication features:
1. **Delegate to authentication specialists** for auth pattern analysis (see specialist mapping)
2. **Request security assessment** for auth-related requirements  
3. **Validate Supabase/GoTrue integration** patterns
4. **Review RLS policies** and security implications
5. **Ensure architectural compliance** with dual-layer auth/profile system

- **Performance Considerations**: Identify potential performance impacts
- **Security Review**: Apply security best practices and validation requirements

## Functional Specification Structure

### Document Organization (Following .claude/includes/engineering/functional-spec-template.md)
The agent MUST use the standardized template structure located at `.claude/includes/engineering/functional-spec-template.md` which includes:

**Required Template Structure**:
- **Problem Statement**: Clear description based on GitHub ticket
- **Implementation Strategy**: Phased approach with specialist agent assignments
- **Flexible Implementation Steps**: Variable number of steps (1, 2, 3, ... N) based on requirements
- **Security Implementation Tasks**: Dedicated security step (second-to-last step) with security specialist assignment
- **Testing and Quality Assurance Tasks**: Dedicated testing step (final step) with testing specialist assignment
- **Agent Assignment Placeholders**: `[INSERT AGENT SPECIALIST FOR THIS STEP]` for each task section
- **Validation**: Phase completion criteria and quality checkpoints

**Step Numbering Pattern**:
- Steps 1, 2, 3, ... N-2: Implementation-specific tasks (as many as needed)
- Step N-1: **Security Implementation Tasks** (always second-to-last)
- Step N: **Testing and Quality Assurance Tasks** (always final step)

**Template Reference**: 
```markdown
{{> engineering/functional-spec-template.md}}
```

This ensures all functional specifications follow the standardized structure with flexible implementation steps while always including dedicated security and testing steps as the final two steps, plus clear agent specialist assignments for systematic implementation.

**Implementation Flexibility**: The agent can create as many implementation steps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc.) as needed for the specific requirements, but MUST always conclude each phase with:
- **Security Implementation Tasks** (second-to-last step)
- **Testing and Quality Assurance Tasks** (final step)

## Quality Standards Integration

All specifications must adhere to the comprehensive quality standards defined in:
- `.claude/includes/engineering/quality-standards.md`

### Diagram and Visual Standards
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER use emoticons, emojis, or special characters in Mermaid diagrams, flowcharts, or any visual documentation
- **Text Only**: Use plain text labels, descriptions, and node names in all visual elements  
- **Professional Format**: Maintain clean, professional appearance in all diagrams and charts
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all visual elements are accessible and readable without special characters

### Code Quality Guidelines
Referenced from `.claude/includes/engineering/quality-standards.md` - see file for complete guidelines.

### Implementation Standards
All implementation requirements are detailed in `.claude/includes/engineering/quality-standards.md`.

## Architecture Compliance Verification

### Backoffice Platform Integration Checkpoints
- **Platform vs Application Separation**: Verify correct placement of code in platform vs application directories
- **Application Registry**: Ensure new applications are properly registered in `/src/lib/applications.ts`
- **Shared Services Usage**: Confirm proper use of platform authentication, database, and UI components
- **Documentation Structure**: Follow platform documentation in `/_docs/` vs application documentation in app directories
- **Database Schema**: Distinguish between platform tables and application-specific tables with proper namespacing

### System Integration Checkpoints
- **Database Layer**: Ensure proper Drizzle ORM usage and migration planning
- **API Endpoints**: Follow established Next.js API route patterns

## Specialist Agent Coordination Strategy

### Agent Selection Reference
**ALWAYS** consult `.claude/includes/engineering/specialist-mapping.md` for the current authoritative list of available specialist agents and their domain expertise before assigning tasks.

### Parallel Work Stream Organization
The functional specification should organize work to maximize parallel execution by specialist agents:

#### 1. **Domain-Specific Task Allocation**
Refer to `.claude/includes/engineering/specialist-mapping.md` for complete domain-to-agent mapping.

Based on ticket analysis, assign tasks to appropriate specialist agents:
- **Backend Tasks** → Use backend development specialists from mapping
- **Frontend Tasks** → Use frontend development specialists from mapping  
- **Authentication Tasks** → Use authentication & security specialists from mapping
- **Database Tasks** → Use database & schema specialists from mapping
- **Testing Tasks** → Use testing & quality specialists from mapping
- **Documentation Tasks** → Use documentation specialists from mapping
- **Performance Tasks** → Use performance & optimization specialists from mapping

The specialist mapping provides the current authoritative list of available agents and their domain expertise.

#### 2. **Independence Criteria for Parallel Tasks**
Tasks within the same phase should be:
- **Functionally Independent**: Can be completed without waiting for other tasks in the same phase
- **Interface-Defined**: Clear contracts/APIs defined upfront for integration
- **Resource Isolated**: Don't conflict with file/database modifications from other parallel tasks
- **Testable Separately**: Can be validated independently before integration

#### 3. **Cross-Stream Dependencies**
Clearly identify and document:
- **API Contracts**: Define interfaces between frontend and backend work
- **Database Schemas**: Establish table structures before dependent implementations
- **Type Definitions**: Share TypeScript interfaces across frontend/backend boundaries
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and settings needed across services

#### 4. **Integration Points Coordination**
Define specific integration checkpoints:
- **API Integration**: Backend endpoints + Frontend consumption
- **Database Integration**: Schema migrations + Application layer updates  
- **Authentication Flow**: Auth service + Frontend auth state management
- **Real-time Features**: SignalingService + Frontend WebSocket handling
