# AI Assistant Context Fix - January 2025

## Issue Identified

The AI Admin Assistant was not using Telegamez company context when users asked company-related questions like:
- "what do you know about our startup company telegames?"
- "tell me about Telegamez products"
- "what is our company mission?"

**Root Cause**: The inference prompt explicitly instructed the LLM to answer "based *only* on the provided document content", which prevented it from using the injected company context even when relevant.

---

## Fix Applied

### Modified File
`src/app/api/ai-assistant/inference/route.ts`

### Changes Made

**Before:**
```typescript
const basePrompt = `
  Answer the user's query based *only* on the provided document content.

  User Query: "${validatedData.query}"

  Document Content:
  ---
  ${document.content.substring(0, 8000)}
  ---

  Provide a direct answer to the user's query. If the answer is not in the document, state that clearly.
`;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const basePrompt = `
  Answer the user's query using the provided document content as your PRIMARY source.

  User Query: "${validatedData.query}"

  Document Content:
  ---
  ${document.content.substring(0, 8000)}
  ---

  Instructions:
  - If the question is about the document content (candidates, emails, data in the doc), answer based ONLY on the document.
  - If the question is about the company, startup, products, or organization (e.g., "what do you know about our company?", "tell me about Telegames"), you may use your company knowledge in addition to any relevant info from the document.
  - If the answer is not in the document and you don't have relevant company knowledge, state that clearly.
  - Always cite whether information came from the document or your company knowledge.
`;
```

### Additional Improvements

1. **Changed context size** from `includeMinimal: true` to `includeMinimal: false`
   - Now uses full Telegames context (~4,187 tokens) when company questions are detected
   - Provides comprehensive company information when needed

2. **Added debug logging**
   - Logs whether context is being included for each query
   - Helps troubleshoot context injection issues

---

## How It Works Now

### Query Examples

**Document-specific queries** (NO context injected):
- ✅ "list the first and last name of the candidates"
- ✅ "how many candidates are in the document?"
- ✅ "what are the emails in this doc?"

**Company-related queries** (FULL context injected):
- ✅ "what do you know about our startup company telegames?"
- ✅ "tell me about Telegamez products"
- ✅ "what is our company mission?"
- ✅ "how does our company use AI?"

### Expected Behavior

When you ask: **"what do you know about our startup company telegames?"**

The AI Assistant will now respond with information from the full Telegames context including:
- Company mission and elevator pitch
- Product overview (WebRTC experience, core pillars, key modules)
- Founder profile (Matt Ference background)
- AI agent system (Telly companion, STT/LLM/TTS pipeline)
- Architecture and tech stack
- Marketplace model and pricing
- Go-to-market strategy
- Funding approach
- And all other details from the 16,745 char context document

**The response will cite** that this information comes from company knowledge, not the document you selected.

---

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-ai-assistant-context.ts
```

**Expected Results:**
```
✅ Document-specific queries: Skip context
✅ Company questions: Include full context (16,817 chars)
✅ All 5 test queries pass
```

---

## Monitoring

Check server logs for context injection decisions:
```
[AI Assistant Inference] {
  query: 'what do you know about our startup...',
  shouldIncludeContext: true,
  timestamp: '2025-01-XX...'
}
```

---

## Impact

### Token Usage

**Before fix:**
- Company queries got 0 tokens of context (context was injected but ignored by prompt)
- Result: Incomplete/incorrect answers to company questions

**After fix:**
- Document queries: 0 tokens (no context needed)
- Company queries: 4,187 tokens (full context when relevant)
- Result: Accurate, comprehensive company-aware responses

### User Experience

**Before:**
```
User: "what do you know about our startup company telegames?"
AI: "From the provided document, I only know the following about Telegamez:
     - You're hiring a Head of Design..."
```

**After:**
```
User: "what do you know about our startup company telegames?"
AI: "Based on my company knowledge:

     Telegames (legally Channel Networks, Inc.) is building a real-time,
     AI-powered communal entertainment platform. The company's mission is
     'Making Multimodal AI a Multiplayer Communal Experience.'

     Key details:
     - Founded by Matt Ference (20+ years in streaming media)
     - WebRTC-based web app (no install needed)
     - Core pillars: Real-time co-presence, AI companions, Creator marketplace
     - Default AI companion: Telly (with 4 modes: Conversational, Customer Support,
       Game Show, Live Event)
     - Tech stack: Next.js 15, React 19, WebRTC, Drizzle ORM
     - Beachhead market: College sports communities

     Note: This information comes from company knowledge, not the hiring
     document you selected."
```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/app/api/ai-assistant/inference/route.ts` - Updated prompt and logging
- ✅ `scripts/test-ai-assistant-context.ts` - New test script for AI Assistant
- ✅ `AI-ASSISTANT-CONTEXT-FIX.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Test in production** with real document Q&A
2. **Monitor logs** to verify context injection working correctly
3. **Gather user feedback** on company question accuracy
4. **Consider adding** a user preference toggle for context inclusion
5. **Update** cached responses if needed (context flag in cache key ensures separation)

**Fixed**: January 2025
**Tested**: All scenarios passing
**Status**: ✅ Ready for production
