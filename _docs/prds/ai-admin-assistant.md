# WHAT WE BUILD vs WHAT USERS SHOULD USE NATIVELY

## Use Google Workspace For These (DON'T RECREATE):
- ✅ **File Organization**: Creating folders, sharing permissions, file management
- ✅ **Email Composition**: Basic email writing, formatting, attachments  
- ✅ **Email Management**: Reading, searching, organizing emails
- ✅ **Calendar Functions**: Creating meetings, scheduling, calendar views
- ✅ **Document Editing**: Text editing, formatting, collaboration features
- ✅ **Spreadsheet Operations**: Data entry, formulas, charts

## We Build These UNIQUE Capabilities:
- 🤖 **AI Document Analysis**: Extract contacts, tasks, insights from documents
- 🤖 **Bulk Personalization**: Generate individualized emails from document context
- 🤖 **Cross-Platform Workflows**: Automate Drive → Gmail processes
- 🤖 **Intelligent Summaries**: AI-powered daily workflow insights
- 🤖 **Workflow Automation**: Complex multi-step processes Google can't do

## User Experience Philosophy:
**"Click here to use Google Drive"** vs **"Click here for AI automation"**

Users should think: 
- *"I need to edit this document"* → Use Google Drive
- *"I need to send a campaign based on this document"* → Use AI Admin Assistant

## Risk Mitigation for ASAP Timeline

### Technical Risks
- **API Discovery**: Start with Google API playground to validate capabilities
- **OAuth Complexity**: Test scope expansion incrementally
- **AI Performance**: Begin with simple document types (Google Docs only)

### Scope Management
- **Start Simple**: Single document → single email for initial testing
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add bulk operations once core flow works
- **Fail Fast**: Validate each integration step before moving forward
