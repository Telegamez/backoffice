# Product Requirements Document: Always-On Autonomous Agent Scheduler

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Vision
Enable users to automate their digital workflows through natural language by creating an always-on autonomous agent that understands, schedules, and executes repeatable tasks across Google services, web search, and social media platforms.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Users spend significant time on repetitive information gathering and synthesis tasks:
- Manually checking calendars, emails, and trending topics daily
- Context-switching between multiple platforms (Gmail, YouTube, Twitter, Google Search)
- Missing relevant information due to information overload
- Inability to maintain consistent daily routines without manual intervention

### 1.3 Solution
An intelligent agent that:
1. Accepts natural language task descriptions from users
2. Automatically interprets, schedules, and executes tasks
3. Aggregates data from multiple sources (Google Calendar, Gmail, YouTube, Search, Twitter)
4. Applies intelligent filtering and personalization
5. Delivers results via email or document storage
6. Learns user preferences over time

### 1.4 Target Users
- **Primary**: Startup founders and executives who need daily briefings combining calendar, trending topics, and industry news
- **Secondary**: Knowledge workers who perform repetitive research and reporting tasks
- **Tertiary**: Teams needing automated status reports and digest emails

### 1.5 Success Criteria
- 100+ active scheduled tasks within 3 months of launch
- 80%+ task retention rate (tasks still active after 30 days)
- 99%+ successful execution rate
- <60 second average task execution time
- NPS >40 after 3 months

## 5. Technical Constraints

### 5.1 API Limits
- **Google Search API**: 100 queries/day (free tier)
- **YouTube Data API**: 10,000 quota units/day
- **Gmail API**: 1 billion quota units/day (effectively unlimited for our use case)
- **Twitter API**: Requires paid tier ($100/month) for trending endpoints

### 5.2 LLM Costs
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro**: $3.50/1M input tokens, $10.50/1M output tokens
- **Budget**: Target <$0.10 per task execution average
- **Mitigation**: Use Gemini Flash for bulk operations, cache prompts

### 5.3 Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Must run 24/7 with minimal downtime
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for task storage, possible Redis for caching
- **Queue**: Required for long-running tasks and retry logic

## 6. User Experience Requirements

### 6.1 Onboarding Flow
1. User signs in with Google OAuth
2. User grants permissions for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc.
3. Guided tutorial: "Create your first task"
4. Example prompts provided for common use cases
5. First task requires approval with explanation of what will happen

### 6.2 Task Creation Experience
- **Input**: Large text area with placeholder examples
- **Response**: "I'll create a task that [human-readable summary]. It will run [schedule]. You'll receive results via [delivery method]. Does this look right?"
- **Edit**: Inline editing of schedule, filters, delivery before approval
- **Preview**: Show sample output before first execution

### 6.3 Email Deliverables
- **Subject line**: Clear, actionable (e.g., "Your Daily Briefing - January 15, 2025")
- **Structure**:
  - Greeting with time-appropriate language
  - Calendar summary with next 3-5 events
  - Trending topics grouped by source
  - Footer with manage/unsubscribe links
- **Formatting**: Clean HTML, mobile-responsive, accessible

### 6.4 Error Handling
- **User-facing errors**: Plain language explanations, no stack traces
- **Retry logic**: Transparent ("Retrying in 30 seconds...")
- **Permanent failures**: Actionable guidance ("Please re-authorize Google Calendar")

## 7. Out of Scope (v1)

The following features are explicitly excluded from the initial release:
- Multi-user team workspaces
- Task sharing between users
- Mobile native apps (iOS/Android)

## 12. Open Questions

1. **Pricing Model**: Free tier limits? Paid plans for power users?
   - *Recommendation*: Free for 10 tasks/user, $10/month for unlimited

2. **Twitter Alternative**: If Twitter API is too expensive?
   - *Recommendation*: Launch with Google + YouTube only, add Twitter later

3. **Multi-Timezone Support**: How to handle users in different timezones?
   - *Recommendation*: Auto-detect from Google Calendar, allow override

4. **Email Deliverability**: Send from user's Gmail or system sender?
   - *Recommendation*: User's Gmail (better deliverability, clear provenance)

5. **Task Approval**: Opt-in or opt-out by default?
   - *Recommendation*: Opt-in for first 3 tasks, then auto-approve

6. **LLM Provider**: Gemini only or multi-provider from day 1?
   - *Recommendation*: Gemini only for MVP, add abstraction layer for future

7. **Failure Notifications**: Email, SMS, or in-app only?
   - *Recommendation*: Email only for MVP

## 13. Appendix

### 13.1 Example Task Prompts

**Example 1: Daily Briefing**
```
Every morning at 7am Pacific Time, send me an email summarizing my day based on
my Google Calendar. Search the web for the top 10 trending items on Google Search
and YouTube. Filter results to highlight posts with an AI context, and include
anything relevant to my startup Telegames. Use a motivational tone.
```

**Example 2: Weekly Report**
```
Every Friday at 5pm, create a Google Doc summarizing my week. Include all calendar
events, emails I sent, and trending topics in the startup space. Title it
"Weekly Review - [date]" and save to my Drive.
```

**Example 3: Research Digest**
```
Every Monday and Thursday at 9am, search YouTube for new videos about "LangChain"
and "LangGraph" and email me the top 5 with summaries. Use a professional tone.
