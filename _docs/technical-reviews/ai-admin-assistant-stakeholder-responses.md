**Response Date:** August 13, 2025  
**Review Document:** `_docs/technical-reviews/ai-admin-assistant-technical-prd-review.md`  
**Status:** ✅ **CLARIFICATIONS PROVIDED**

## Executive Stakeholder Decisions

After reviewing the technical assessment, the following decisions have been made to ensure project feasibility and success:

**Approved Revisions:**
- ✅ Performance targets revised to realistic expectations
- ✅ Infrastructure scaling approved (Redis, background processing)
- ✅ Timeline extended to 8-12 weeks for proper implementation
- ✅ Phased rollout approach accepted

## Response to Critical Clarifications

### 1. Performance Expectations Revision ✅ APPROVED

**Stakeholder Decision:** Accept revised realistic performance targets

**Original vs Revised Targets:**
| Operation | Original PRD | Revised Target | Approved |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Document Analysis | <2 seconds | 5-15 seconds | ✅ Yes |
| Bulk Email Generation | <5 seconds | 30s-2 minutes | ✅ Yes |
| Complex Documents | Not specified | Up to 30 seconds | ✅ Yes |
| Background Processing | Real-time only | Acceptable with progress tracking | ✅ Yes |

**Rationale:**
- User experience remains excellent with proper loading states and progress indicators
- Background processing allows for more reliable bulk operations
- Realistic targets prevent technical debt and over-engineering
- Performance can be incrementally improved post-MVP

**UI/UX Requirements for Revised Targets:**
- Progress bars and estimated completion times
- Ability to continue other work while processing
- Clear status indicators and notifications
- Background processing with email notifications when complete

### 2. Google Workspace API Strategy ✅ CONFIRMED

**API Access Approach:** Service Account + Domain-Wide Delegation

**Decisions:**
- ✅ **Service Account Setup:** Implement Google Workspace service account for enterprise-grade access

- Send: 1,000,000,000 quota units per day
- Read: 2,000 per user per second

Google Calendar API:
- Requests: 1,000 per 100 seconds per user
```

**Quota Management Strategy:**
- Implement intelligent rate limiting with user feedback
