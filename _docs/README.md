## Documentation Conventions

### Platform vs Application Documentation

**Platform Documentation (`_docs/`):**
- Covers shared services and infrastructure
- Authentication, database, deployment
- Guidelines for all applications
- Platform-wide troubleshooting

**Application Documentation (`src/app/apps/[app]/README.md`):**
- Application-specific features and usage
- App-specific APIs and database schemas
- Application troubleshooting and configuration
- User guides for that specific application

### File Naming Conventions
- **Platform docs**: Numbered for logical flow (`10-setup.md`, `40-deploy.md`)
- **Application docs**: `README.md` in the application directory
- **PRDs**: `prds/[application-name].md`
- **Shared resources**: Descriptive names (`contributing.md`, `operations.md`)

## Documentation Maintenance

### When to Update Platform Docs
- Changes to authentication or shared services
- New deployment procedures or infrastructure
- Platform-wide troubleshooting additions
- New application development guidelines

### When to Update Application Docs
- New application features or APIs
- Application-specific configuration changes
- App-specific troubleshooting procedures
- User interface or workflow changes

### Documentation Review Process
1. **Technical accuracy**: Verify all instructions work
2. **Completeness**: Ensure all features are documented
3. **Clarity**: Test with someone unfamiliar with the code
4. **Currency**: Remove outdated information

## Getting Started with Documentation

### For New Developers
1. Read the platform [`README.md`](../README.md) for overview
2. Follow [`10-setup.md`](10-setup.md) for development setup
3. Review [`contributing.md`](contributing.md) for development guidelines
4. Check application READMEs for specific tools you'll work on

### For New Users
1. Start with the platform [`README.md`](../README.md)
2. Navigate to specific application documentation as needed
3. Use [`operations.md`](operations.md) for troubleshooting

1. Review [`40-deploy.md`](40-deploy.md) for deployment procedures
2. Study [`operations.md`](operations.md) for daily operations
3. Monitor PRDs in `prds/` for upcoming development needs

## Documentation Standards

### Writing Guidelines
- **Clear and Concise**: Use simple language and short sentences
- **Actionable**: Provide specific steps and commands
- **Current**: Keep information up-to-date with code changes
- **Complete**: Include setup, usage, and troubleshooting

### Code Examples

- Include expected outputs when helpful
- Provide environment context (development vs production)
- Test all examples before publishing

### Screenshots and Diagrams
- Keep visual aids current with UI changes
- Use consistent styling and annotations
- Store images in appropriate subdirectories
- Provide alt text for accessibility

## Contributing to Documentation
